# Dogtastic-Social-Meetup
This project was built to create an application that will be a viable resource for community/neighbors to create a social network encompassing a shared love of dogs.
It is an ASP.net MVC 5 application on Entity framework. Deployed with Azure.

What does it do? It collects user and dog data in data tables and allows users to create a playdate with saved information.
How does it work? Users register themselves as a Parent, registers their dog, and create a playdate with a calendar and time picker. Users can see all parents, dogs, and playdates, but can only edit their own.
